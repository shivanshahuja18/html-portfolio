    <h2>PROJECTS</h2>
    <h3>Solar Tracking System :</h3>
    <p>A model that works on the movement of sun to increase efficiency<br/>
        of the power production by solar panels from sunlight. It was a Dual<br/> 
        axis tracking model that adjusts the position of the solar panels<br/>
        along two axes (both horizontal and vertical). It allows for more<br/>
        precise alignment with the sun's position throughout the day. </p>
    <h3>Smart Dustbin :</h3>
    <p>A model for managing waste and maintaining hygiene. This model<br/>
        incorporates various systems to monitor, manage, and optimize the<br/>
        process. It automatically opens the lid, separates the different<br/> 
        types of waste, automatically compresses the waste in the bin<br/>
        using pneumatic system and also notifies the person in-charge <br/>
        when the bin is completely filled up. </p>
    <h3>Automatic Irrigation System :</h3>
    <p>A system that works on the water requirement of the crops. It <br/>
        checks the moisture content of the soil, and automatically supplies <br/>
        the water to the soil when needed.</p>
